Asking Your Question
********************

If you are asking for help in your specific application, debugging build
errors, or general usage, please ask a
`StackOverflow question <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pybind11>`_
or ask on `Gitter <https://gitter.im/pybind>`_.

If you are confident your question is either a bug report, feature request, or
a much more complex question, please post a
`GitHub issue <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/new>`_.

When you post your issue, *please* give the relevant context as possible (most
importantly: what you are trying to do), and provide minimal and self-contained
reproduction code.
